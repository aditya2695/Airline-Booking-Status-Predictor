### Evaluation

<ul>
    <li> 
        The most important variable in the model was
        purchase_lead, that is the time between purchase and
        departure.
    </li> 
    <li>  
        Information about the flight, e.g. flight time and
        duration was also significant, however booking origin of
        the customer was not important.
    </li> 
    <li> 
        The accuracy of the model was approximately 0.7
        (Precision) and 0.003 (Recall), showing that this model
        requires more improvement. I suggest adding more
        customer-centric features into the model.
